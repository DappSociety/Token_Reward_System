# Token_Reward_System
Place to collaborate and build our tokenized reward system for bootstrapping projects. 


## How to contribute?
Each file has its own master branch, `/wip/filename/master`, where all contributions are put together. Once we are ready, we can move this WIP to the master branch of the repository. (**Note:** The master of the repository is not the same as the master for the WIP file.)

To contribute you should:

1. Fork the master branch (`/wip/filename/master`) and name your branch following this format: /wip/filename/username
  * If the master branch for the file hasn't yet been created, fork the master branch of the whole repository and give it the following name: `/wip/filename/master`
2. Commit changes to the post file.
3. Before merging the changes into the files master branch (`/wip/filename/master`) it is important to pull to get all changes committed by other users while you were working on your branch.
4. Merge your changes into the files master (NOT the repository's master)
