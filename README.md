# Token_Reward_System
Place to collaborate and build our tokenized reward system for bootstrapping projects. 


## How to contribute?
Each file has its own master branch, `/wip/filename/master`, where all contributions are put together. Once we are ready, we can move this WIP to the master branch of the repository. (**Note:** The master of the repository is not the same as the master for the WIP file.)

To contribute you should:

1. Fork the master branch (`/wip/filename/master`) and name your branch following this format: /wip/filename/username
     * If the master branch for the file hasn't yet been created, fork the master branch of the whole repository and give it the following name: `/wip/filename/master`
2. Commit changes to the post file.
3. Before merging the changes into the files master branch (`/wip/filename/master`) it is important to pull from the files master to get all changes committed by other users while you were working on your branch. This way you can make sure your edits are compatible before merging your edits into the master. 
4. Merge your changes into the files master (NOT the repository's master)
5. Follow this merging process frequently so the whole community is updated on your work. 

**This procedure is the same as the one we used in our `digest_archive` repo. If we feel it should be changed for this repo, go ahead and make the edits here or comment about it in the Slack!**
